        <p>
		Open git bash from right click menu contex after you install git 
        </p>
		Ensure that you have the git submenu
		<br><hr>

	<h3>What about notepad ?  </h3>
	<p>
	Do you know we can create new text file and write to it by running notepad from terminal ?
    </p>
	<br>

		After that you can confirm the new file and start typing

	<h2>.bashrc script file </h2>
	<p align="left">
	
	.bashrc is a shell script that Bash runs whenever it is started interactively. It initializes an interactive shell session.
<br>	You can put any command in that file that you could type at the command prompt.

<br>You put commands here to set up the shell for use in your particular environment, 
<br>or to customize things to your preferences. 
<br>A common thing to put in .bashrc are aliases that you want to always be available.
	</p>
	<h3 align="left" >
	
	And to define your (PS1) prompt and define other settings that you want to use every time you open a new terminal window.<br>
	

It works by being run each time you open up a new terminal, window or pane.<br>

A super minimal content of .bashrc might have the following: <br>

export CLICOLOR=1<br>
export LANG="en_US.UTF-8"<br>
alias cp="cp -i"<br>
alias ls="ls --color=auto" <br>
export PS1="\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ "<br>
export EDITOR="vim"<br>
That's all you really know to get started<br>
	</h3>
	
	<p align="left">
	So can we simplify editing .bashrc using notepad  ? <br>
	of course we can  just type <b>notepad ~/.bashrc</b>
	If the file not there you will be prompted to create it so go ahead <br>
	once created you can start put the alias and path you need  <br>
	<br>
	As example you can copy and paste these on the file and save <br>
	export PATH="$PATH:~/Anaconda3:~/Anaconda3/Scripts" <br>
	echo 'alias python="winpty python.exe"' <br>
